# Population Genetic Simulations 9 September 2025

Last week we covered the causes of evolution and how these factors interact with effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>).
Today we are going to use a population genetic simulator created by [CJ Battey](http://cjbattey.com/). The simulation tool can be 
found [here](https://cjbattey.shinyapps.io/driftR/).

&nbsp;

We will be working on simulations to understand how N<sub>e</sub> and the causes of evolution interact to change allele and
genotype frequencies in populations through time. We will go through a brief example of how it works at the beginning of 
class. After that, go through the worksheet and associated critical thinking questions.
